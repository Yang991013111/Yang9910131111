                in Greek mythology, with a very prominent
                and respected status. She is the great mother
                goddess in ancient Greek mythology, the creator

                in the universe, and the ancestor goddess of all

                The iPhone is a series of smartphones produced by Apple that use
                Apple's own iOS mobile operating system. The first iPhone was
                announced on January 9, 2007 by then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs. Since
                then, Apple has released new iPhone models and iOS updates every
                year. As of November 1, 2018, over 2.2 billion iPhones have been sold.
                The iPhone was the first mobile phone to use multi-touch technology.
                [3] Since the iPhone was introduced, it has gained larger screen sizes,
                video recording, waterproofing, and many accessibility features.

                Mobile phone manufacturing involves the consumption of a large
                number of resources, including rare metals, plastics and energy.
                Rare metals such as lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements are
                widely used in mobile phone batteries, screens and electronic
                components. Their mining and processing will have a negative
                impact on the environment and communities. In addition, the
                mobile phone manufacturing process will also produce a large
                amount of wastewater, waste gas and waste, causing pollution to
                water sources and air quality.
